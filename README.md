# Spacewar
This really needs a new name. Really.

## Goal
A sprite-based game where players fly Asteroids-style ships and shoot at 
each other. It should run on a Raspberry Pi and demonstrate good coding
practices including test-driven development.

## Objectives

* Object-oriented code
* Test-driven development

## Gameplay

### User controls

| key   | action        |
|-------|---------------|
| J     | rotate left   |
| L     | rotate right  |
| K     | thrust        |
| I     | fire          |

## Ideas for future systems:

### Starship features

* Heading (rotation): With or without gyros
* Heading: Speed of rotation
* Thrust: Power
* Missiles
* Guided missiles
* Hyperspace
* Shields
    
### Game features

* Starfield
* Sun (gravity)
* Black hole
* Wrap, bounce, stop
* Cloud area which adds drag
